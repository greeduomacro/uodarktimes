Changelog:
==========

Version 2008-04-07
	-added the example command [gendemontriumvirate that places spawners for demon triumvirate on three islands 
	 around the Felucca shrine of Valor
	-added boolean property "BuffOthersOnKill", which will cause linked creatures to give some
	 hitpoints to other linked creatures, and increase their resistances (to a max of 95).  With this set true,
	 the survivors of a linked creature set will become more difficult.

Version 2008-04-01
	-added some more properties to BaseLinkedCreature to give more control over link rule customization.
	See notes.txt for details
	-added "guarded" doors and teleporters, that can deny access to (and boot players/pets from) a "guarded
	region" until whatever guarding linked creatures are defeated.  Details in notes.txt
	-added some documentation about spawning linked creatures.  Details in notes.txt
	-added several more examples of linked creatures

Version 2008-03-31
	-Initial release


Compatibility:
--------------

This was developed using a RunUO 2.0 SVN 286 server.  Compatibility with other servers is
guaranteed only so far as compatibility with a RunUO 2.0 SVN 286 server.

Notes:
------

-Use of this package should require little understanding of how it works.  Modification of the items provided
should also require little understanding of it.  


General Idea:
-------------

Linked creatures are based on BaseMobile's, which make up pretty much every NPC monster you'll ever find.  
The difference, is they cannot be damaged or killed unless every linked creature is being attacked 
simultaneously.  You can easily make a linked creature by copying your favorite creature class, making it
an inherited class of BaseLinkedCreature, and giving it some unique name (eg. Dragon -> LinkedDragon).

How a creature links with other creatures depends on how you tell it to.  It can link to creatures within
a region where they spawn (for maximum effectiveness I recommend setting your spawner to spawn all at once),
or you can tell them to link globally (meaning it will connect up with any "linkable" creature in the world).

The whole point of this is to provide a new way to encourage multiplayer group participation.  If you're 
looking for a way to get your players to work together, then what better way than to stick several linked 
creatures all around the world, and have them form parties to synchronize their attacks?  Or maybe there's a 
swarm guarding a locked gate, and the only way to open it is to clear the room of several pesky rats (which 
are undefeatable unless each rat is taken down simultaneously).

Don't like pets?  Neither do I!  If you want your linked creature invulnerable to pets, there's a toggle for
that, and pets will be both ineffective in damage, and will not register as an attacker for the synchronous
attack check.  If you're really mean, you can set the linked creature to kill pets the second they come into 
contact.


Warning!!
---------
 
A word of caution.  Each linked creature will need at least one aggressor attacking it for any linked creature
to take damage.  If you make a room full of these, you had better expect there to be enough players and pets
to go around.  Either that, or make sure your linked creatures can be provoked on each other.  If you fill
the room with more attackables than attackers, they will be undefeatable.  Even [kill won't touch them!!

In the event you need to remove these creatures, I recommend you turn off your spawner, and use the [remove
command rather than the [kill command.


Limitations:
------------

For obvious reasons, linked creatures must not be made tamable.  This is enforced in the file 
BaseLinkedCreature.cs, and even if you set Tamable = true in your customized linked creature, you still
will not be able to tame it based on the code I put in there.  If you feel like messing with it and making
them tamable, then don't be surprised if your players are walking around with indestructable monsters.

Also, I have no clue how the custom shrink system or taming BOD system will behave with these.  
I would expect it to be messy.  I would suggest you don't try.  


Creating Linked Creatures:
-------------------------

A few example linked creatures can be found in the "Defined Examples" folder.  All that needs to be done to make your own
is to copy your favorite mobile you want to make linked, give it a new class name (eg. Cow -> LinkedCow),
make it inherit from BaseLinkedCreature and then attach the (optional) linking controls within the class 
(before the constructor is a good place).


Linking Controls:
-----------------

You can define how one creature links to another by modifying a set of parameters.  To illustrate these
controls, I have made a few example creatures in the "Defined Examples" folder.  Feel free to modify these, play with
their settings, and add to them as you see fit.


There's a block at the top of the example creatures that looks like this (true/false values may be different).

		//set this true to allow them to link to any linkable anywhere in the world
		public override bool GlobalScopeLink{ get{ return false; } }
		
		//set this true to allow them to link to other cross-creature linkable types of linkable creatures
		public override bool CrossCreatureLink{ get{ return false; } }
		
		//set this false in an inherited class to disallow them to link with the same class of creature
		public virtual bool LinkToSameClass{ get{ return true; } }
		
		//set this true in an inherited class to allow the creature to link with linkable creatures in an opposite scope ( global vs. local )
		public virtual bool CrossScopeLink{ get{ return false; } }

		//set this true in an inherited creature to disallow pets from damaging the creature
		public virtual bool BlockPetDamage{ get{ return false; } }
		
		//set this true in an inherited creature to slaughter pets on contact
		public virtual bool KillPets{ get{ return false; } }
		
		//set this higher in an inherited creature to force this number to link before the creatures are attackable
		public virtual int MinLinkNum{ get{ return 0; } }
		
		//set this in an inherited creature to cap the number to link.  0 means unlimited # of links
		public virtual int MaxLinkNum{ get{ return 0; } }
		
		//set this true in an inherited creature to force all creatures to be killed at once
		public virtual bool SynchKill{ get{ return false; } }
		
		//set this true in an inherited creature to buff all surviving creatures when one is killed
		public virtual bool BuffOthersOnKill{ get{ return false; } }
		

Details listed below.

GlobalScopeLink:  

	False:	-the creatures will only look in their immediate vicinity for creatures to link to
	True: 	-the creatures will link to any linkable candidates anywhere in the world
	
CrossCreatureLink:

	False: 	-will not attempt to link to other types of linked creatures (eg. LinkedDragon will not link with LinkedOrc)
			-will refuse linking with other types of linked creatures
	True:	-will link to other types of linked creatures that also have CrossCreatureLink set true
	
	
LinkToSameClass:
	
	False:	-will not link to same class.  Make sure CrossCreatureLink is set true or this creature will never link
	True:	-will link to creatures of the same class
	
	
CrossScopeLink:

	False:	-will not attempt to link to creatures with different GlobalScopeLink value.  Meaning a global-linking critter will not link
			 with a vicinity-linking critter			
			-will deny linking with creatures with a different GlobalScopeLink value
	True:	-will attempt to link to creatures with a different GlobalScopeLink value

BlockPetDamage:
	
	False:	-pets can be used as normal to engage and damage the linked creature
	True:	-pets will not do damage to the linked creature
			-only players can perform the synchronous attacking

KillPets:

	False:	-no effect
	True:	-when a pet is attacked, or a pet attacks, it is killed

MinLinkNum:

Integer count of how many other creatures this must link to before it becomes visible to players.  The
creature will remain hidden until the number of linked creatures is at least this.

MaxLinkNum:

Integer count of how many other creatures this can link to.  If the creature has linked to this number 
(including itself), it will refuse any more links.


SynchKill:

	false:	-when the creature is able to take damage, it can be damaged and killed without regard of the
			 linked creatures' health
	true:	-when the creature is able to take damage, it cannot be killed until all the linked creatures
			 are also near death

			 
BuffOthersOnKill:

	false:	-nothing happens
	true:	-when this creature dies, it will give 10% of its max hitpoints to all creatures linked to it, and
			will increase their resists by 5% of its resists, up to a max of 95
			
			 			 
Spawning Linked Creatures:
-------------------------

You should be able to create them through any conventional means, like [add, spawners, etc.  When a linked
creature is added, it is first introduced hidden, frozen, and invulnerable.  This is temporary, and lasts
until the creature has successfully linked (or attempted to link) to other linked creatures.  If the creature
requires a minimum number of links, it will remain invisible until other creatures link up to it, and satisfy
its minimum link requirement.  After the creature is visible, it can be attacked by players subject to the
simultaneous attack of linked creatures rule.
			 
There is a lot of flexibility of how or where you spawn the creatures.  For example, if you want to have several 
monsters spread all around the world, and want them all to spawn before players can attempt to bring them down, 
then do the following:
	-develop a linked creature that links with global scope, and set the minimum link number to match the
	number you want to spawn
	-set down one spawner for each creature, and tell the spawner to spawn only one.  Set respawn delays to
	whatever you desire
	
When the creatures spawn, they will remain hidden until all have spawned.  Players cannot attempt to bring
them down prematurely.

More examples will be listed if requested.

			 
Guarded Doors/Teleporters:
-------------------------

As an extension of the linked creature system, the guarded door/teleporter system can be used to block
access to some location until the "guarding" linked creatures are dispatched.  Just as how linked creatures
can be linked locally or globally, so too can the guarded passages be guarded locally or globally.  If you
set up a door to be guarded by linked creatures that link globally, then the door will not be openable until all
the linked creatures are dispatched.

The region that is guarded can be specified.  When players kill the guarding linked creatures, and gain access
to this region, they are free to walk within it and the door or teleporter is usable.  If the creatures
should respawn and the door/teleporter once again be considered guarded, then any players or pets within
the specified guarded region will be booted out to a (specified) kick point.  This allows for the ability
to have a self-resetting multiplayer quest, without the worry of exploitation by camping the guarded region
which provides the quest reward.

To specify what creature type guards the door/teleporter, simply [props the door/teleporter and configure 
as desired.  To edit this property using [props, select the right arrow, and use the provided target cursor
to target an instance of the desired guard creature.  You need not leave this instance alive, as the system
records the type and is done with the instance provided.

Other properties, such as the guarded region and kick point can also be configured through [props.  Note that
the kick action is disabled if the kick point or guarded region is not specified.
