Hi all.

All infoes are taken from UOGuide.

[FONT="Arial"]Story[/FONT]
[I]Once a great man, Lord Blackthorn's body & soul became twisted by the power of Exodus. Seeking total control over Sosaria, he led a fearsome army, cutting down all who opposed him. Sosaria's salvation lay in a simple peasant named Dawn who valiantly opposed the corrupted Lord and led the people of Sosaria to victory. This music box was given to Dawn in gratitude of her achievements.[/I]

[FONT="Arial"]Features:[/FONT]

Rarity songs are checked from UoGuide.
Gears have right label (for each rarity type) and show song label under name.
Each gear can be used to add its song to a Dawn's music box.
[*]MusicBox comes with 4 common tracks random choosen from tracks available.
It displays correctly how many tracks (grouped by rarity) are in the Box.

It has to be locked down to be used.
Double clicking it, if the clicker is Owner of the house where it is locked down, a menu appears.

Music box retains all gears correctly in same order they are put into.
[*]When a songs starts the box animate.
[/LIST]

I've included in the pack modified Golem, Betrayer and Juggernaut that should spawn common or uncommon track if not paragon and rare tracks if paragon.

In this project I would like to make a replica of OSI Dawn's music box.
I will appreciate every suggestion to make this scripts "more" OSI like.

Some questions are:
[LIST=1]
[*]What are the percentages of gears spawn in monster?
[*]What messages appears on Music Box use? Are mine correct?
[*]What about Music Box behaviour? is it correct? It does stop nearby music boxes from playing?
[*]Is the code clear and debugged enought?
[/LIST]

Notes for installations:
Files in Distro folder must be merged or replaced.
Files in DawnsMusicBox can be placed where you desire.

Good music for all.
